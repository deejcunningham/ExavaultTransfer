# ExavaultTransfer
Azure function that transfers files to Dropbox as they are uploaded to Exavault FTP server.

# Description
This was an interview project for a job that I didn't get :) It is supposed to be implemented as an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/). The function is triggered by webhooks and just makes relevant calls to the [Dropbox api](https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/) and the [Exavault api](https://www.exavault.com/developer/api-docs/) to transfer files as they are uploaded.

Obviously no longer maintained - just here for the portoflio cred.
